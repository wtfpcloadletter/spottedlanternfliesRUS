     <p>A spotted lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula) is an invasive planthopper insect that is native to Asia (specifically China, India, and Vietnam). It was first detected in the United States in Pennsylvania in 2014 and has since spread to many eastern states.

Here's why they are a significant concern:

Agricultural Pest: They feed on the sap of a wide variety of plants, including over 70 species, and pose a severe threat to crops like grapes (vineyards are hit particularly hard), apples, peaches, and various hardwood trees.

Honeydew and Sooty Mold: As they feed, they excrete a sticky, sugary liquid called "honeydew." This honeydew then promotes the growth of black sooty mold, which can cover plants, decks, and outdoor furniture. The mold can stunt plant growth by blocking photosynthesis, and the sticky residue is a major nuisance in outdoor areas, sometimes attracting other insects like wasps.

Rapid Spread: While they don't fly long distances, they are expert "hitchhikers." They lay their egg masses (which look like a smear of gray mud) on almost any smooth surface, including vehicles, rail cars, outdoor equipment, and firewood, allowing them to be accidentally transported to new areas.

Appearance: Adults are about an inch long, with striking looks: their forewings are grayish with black spots, and when they open their wings, they reveal bright red hind wings with black spots and white patches.

In short, they are a major invasive pest that is causing ecological and significant economic damage to agriculture and forests. If you see one, the common advice is to squash it and report the sighting to your local agricultural or extension office.</p>
